## Research Poster

This project aims to assess and plan a transition for North Carolina's statewide Health Information Exchange (HIE) to become a mature Health Data Utility (HDU). By addressing policy and infrastructure barriers to overcome data interoperability issues across organizations, our goal is to improve care coordination, closed-loop referral tracking, and access to non-medical interventions. This poster was presented at Academy Health's 2025 Annual Research Meeting and American Medical Informatics Association 2025 Annual Symposium.
